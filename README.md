# Canteen-Food-Management-System
The page is hosted at https://devforlife07.github.io/Canteen-Food-Management-System/
Canteen Food Management System (CFMS) basically allows the canteen workers to collaborate among themselves on different current orders.
First of all each worker needs to register himself to use this app for which he needs to provide his email-id and he can chose password of his choice.
Next he needs to login via same credentials he provided.
He will be than logged in to his dashboard where he can see the list of current orders getting prepared and he can also take orders.
Once the order is delievered he can remove the order from the list simply by clicking the delievered button.
The delievered button will be visible only when the worker to whom the order was assigned is logged in,it will not be visible to him if he is logged out or some other worker is logged in.
Moreover the list of current orders will also be displayed when the page loads but there will be no delivered button visible.
Things learnt from this project:-
Use of basic CSS Properties like position,flexbox,media-queries.
Bootstrap
Use of javascript to store some data on client side via localstorage.
JSON 
Objects and OOPS in javascript.
Classes,constructors in javascript.
Apart from this the things which I have learned which are not used in project are xhr requests ajax callback functions.
